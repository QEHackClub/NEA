This is an online puzzle game i created for my A level coursework. 
I created a puzzle game and hosted it on a website with a leaderboard linked to a database. The unique problem was ensuring that my puzzle had only one solution.
I ended up generating networks to hold all possible states of the game and implementing traversal algorithms to work out the optimal choice of move through this network to see
if a desired state was achievable. all documentation is in the PDF and the product is live on euanripper.pythonanywhere.com
